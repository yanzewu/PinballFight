It's strongly adviced to create your own branch if you have any modifications.

Basic commands:
    Commit changes:     git commit -am "Info"
    Update from remote: git pull
    Update to remote:   git push
    Discard all changes (cannot undo!): git reset --hard
    Reset one file:     git checkout <filename>
    Switch branch:      git checkout <branchname>
It's recommended to commit changes before switching any branch.
